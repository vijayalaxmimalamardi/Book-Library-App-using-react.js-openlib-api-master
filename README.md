# Book-Library-App-using-react.js-openlib-api-master

Build a mobile application for a book library using **react.js** and **Open Library API**. 

Application should contain:

* Home Page: This page contains of the following
    * Search bar to search books
    * List of books rendered as cards

* Create a component that displays a list of books. Each book item should display book cover, title, author, published year and a book status button that tells whether the book has been 
  read or not.

* Use https://openlibrary.org/people/mekBot/books/already-read.json to render a books list containing at least 20 items. All book item values required above except book status can be 
  found in each object in this JSON response.

* **cover_id** can be found in the book object obtained in the JSON above. Use the cover_id in this API to get the cover image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/{cover_id}-M.jpg

* Book status button will be in a dynamic state. When the button is clicked, the book's status should toggle between "Read" and "Unread" and displayed accordingly. If book status is read 
  then the button should turn green with the text “Read”, else if book status is unread then the button should be a transparent button with a border.

* Search Page:

    * Clicking search bar on home page should allow users to search for books by title
    * Display the search results in a list same as home page UI

* For rendering search results refer this : https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
